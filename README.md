# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅 

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** journey! This repository contains my solutions to this year's daily coding challenges, written in **Python** 🐍. Each day leading up to Christmas, I'll tackle a new problem and share my progress here.

## 🧑‍💻 My Goals

1. **Learn and Improve**: Each problem is an opportunity to refine my Python skills.
2. **Solve Every Puzzle**: Whether it’s Day 1 or Day 25, I’ll try my best to complete all challenges.
3. **Have Fun**: Because coding is better with Christmas cheer! 🎅🎄
